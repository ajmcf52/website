Intellectual curiosity is one of the fundamental tenets of humanity. I find reading lists to be interesting data, 
as they provide a good depiction as to what a person is actively curious about. Personally, I love hearing about books
from which others have drawn insight or inspiration, as this opens the door for me to take in fresh knowledge from a 
different perspective, and that is an exciting prospect to consider.

Below are some books that I i) am currently reading, ii) have previously read, and iii) am looking to read in the future. 
Note that for books previously read, I've only included titles from the past few years that I've found particularly interesting.
