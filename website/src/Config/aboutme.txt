Born 1996 in Surrey Memorial Hospital, AJ is a Canuck by birth; though with time, he finds himself aligning more 
and more with other parts of world outside of Canada, such as Texas.

The Snow Yeti yearns for the opportunity to be a contributor as a member of a tech team that works on the cutting edge, 
preferably building things that are projected to have an enormously positive impact on the world. AJ loves solving 
meaningful complex problems by first breaking them down into small, digestible chunks, after which practical solutions 
typically become much more apparent.

When not at work, AJ is usually either at the gym or programming at some coffee shop. AJ is tremendously passionate
about lifting weights, for the sake of mental health if not for anything else. The positive alteration of body 
composition -- the journey of striving toward looking good in the nude -- is certainly a welcomed notion as well.

For AJ, programming represents the colliding worlds of logic and creativity with possibilities constrained strictly
by the imagination. The prospect of being able to create anything imaginable is an exciting idea to AJ. 

Though still in his infancy as an Engineer, AJ has been touted as a "diamond in the rough". His goals are extremely 
ambitious. This ambition is buttressed by his unrelenting work ethic, excellent communicative ability, infectious
personality, and a desire to win no matter the cost.
