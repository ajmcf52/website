## New Beginnings. Or rather, A fresh start...

Today marks the first significant day of beginning the (re-)work of my website. The last time I touched this code was close to 3 years ago. That being said, it can be inferred that the website is extremely outdated.

The first time I was putting it together, I made a point of trying to show off some React and TypeScript knowledge. Part of this "showing off" was showcasing a mildly interactive resume which, looking back on it, really isn't that good.

This time around, I will be taking a different approach.

I will maintain the interactive nature of the resume while buffing its functionality, making it more responsive and accommodating to screen sizes, but mostly focusing on first accommodating the desktop view in a pleasant manner. Perhaps I will do some research into the responsiveness nature of web apps, particularly in the context of the mobile view; I will have to evaluate how much time incorporating that accommodation will take with respect to my development timeline and other things that I have to get done over the next couple of months. Perhaps there is a framework or library out there that can help me out. I will have to do some digging.

Regarding other things... There are a few points of importance that should be made with respect to my intentions for this app:

- For one, I will be taking the "minimalist" approach with the styling and qualitative manner of the site. In other words, I will be taking a "Content First" approach.
- On that note, I will be injecting 30x more authenticity into the application. The home page will, more or less, feature a concisely articulated essay that attempts to explain what and who I am in the fewest words possible.
- I will be adding a section, either on a separate page or at the bottom of the home page, strictly dedicated to showcasing project work. Specifically, each portion of this section featuring the various projects will consist of a title, a GIF showcasing the app in action, and a series of bulletpoints highlighting some of the more important aspects of each project.
- Last but not least, I will feature links to my blog that I will be building over the next 2-4 weeks. Well, the blog itself is something that I could realistically finish building in a single day using something like Wordpress, it's just a matter of actually getting it done alongside this project.

That's all for now.

The first thing to do will be acquiring artifacts, like the GIFs of my projects working in action. Once I have this done, testing the view of the various GIFs will be much simpler. I think that would be an excellent place to jump in and get my feet wet with web development again.

Until tomorrow.
